# T4Utils 2
A Javascript library of utility classes and extensions for TerminalFour Programmable Layouts. This repo is a port/continuation of [Ben Margevicius'](https://github.com/bdm4) unmaintained [T4Utils](https://github.com/FPBSchoolOfNursing/T4Utils) library.

**Version 1.0.0_2016.09.15**

A complete port of the original [T4Utils](https://github.com/FPBSchoolOfNursing/T4Utils), optimized for TerminalFour Version 8.1. Here's what's new:
* Cleaned up indentation, spacing, and Javascript formatting
* Cleaned up the commenting to render standardized, efficient JSDoc3 documentation
* Fixed 7.4 API calls in the `ordinalIndicators` module to work with 8.1

Check out the [changelog](changelog.md) for previous release information.
