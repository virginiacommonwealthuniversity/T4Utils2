# T4Utils 2

A Javascript library of utility classes and extensions for TerminalFour Programmable Layouts. This repo is a port/continuation of [Ben Margevicius'](https://github.com/bdm4) unmaintained [T4Utils](https://github.com/FPBSchoolOfNursing/T4Utils) library.

## Latest Version

### [v2.0.0 - Build System & Usability Enhancements](https://github.com/virginiacommonwealthuniversity/T4Utils2/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

It's been a while since T4Utils 2 recieved any updates. With v2.0.0, the library has been rewritten from the ground up to support the following features:

1. The use of ES modules and Webpack for bundling
2. Better JSDoc integration for more thorough documentation
3. Removal of redundant, old, or hard-to-maintain code
4. Newly exposed and under-the-hood functions that power core features
5. Use outside content type or page layout contexts
6. Safer and more predictable behavior in edge-cases and debugging

And a whole lot more! This library is a drop-in replacement for the previous version.

Check out the [changelog](changelog.md) for previous release information.
